## What is Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a useful tool where you can configure, deploy and install your cloud infrastructure.

Terraform works on the principle "Infrastructure as code". So to use it, you have to write and run script you need.

So, we thought to make a terraform script "library" which are often used a lot and which you can also use as a base template.

Please feel free to give us feedback and report any errors you may see.
